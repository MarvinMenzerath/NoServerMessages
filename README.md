# NoServerMessages
This tiny Plugin allows you to remove every Join-/Leave-/Death-Message from the Chat and to toggle this behaviour by using a single command.

## Install
Grab a current Release from [here](https://github.com/menzerath/spigot-no-server-messages/releases) and copy it into your Plugins-Directory. That's it.

If you want to disable the plugin temporarily use the `/togglemessages`-command. You will need the permission `servermessages.toggle` or OP.
